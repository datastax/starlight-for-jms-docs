Starlight for JMS is licensed under https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt[Apache version 2.0,window=_blank].

== How can I use Starlight for JMS in a JakartaEE® or JavaEE® application?

You can use the `resourceAdapter` {jms_repo}blob/master/resource-adapter[here,window=_blank].

== How can I run the Test Compatibility Kit (TCK)

You can download the TCK https://jakarta.ee/specifications/messaging/2.0/[here,window=_blank]. The repository contains a copy of the TCK that automates the execution of the tests.

In the tck-executor module you'll find:

* The Java Code needed to initialize the TCK, `JNDIInitialContextFactory.java`.
* The configuration file for the TCK runner, `ts.jte`.
* A file that contains the excluded tests that cannot pass with this client, `ts.jtx`
* Scripts to run Apache Pulsar 2.7.1, configure the Transaction Coordinator, and prepare for the execution of the TCK.

To build the package, run unit tests, and run the TCK:

[source,language-bash]
----
mvn clean install -Prun-tck
----

To run only the TCK:

[source,language-bash]
----
mvn clean install -Prun-tck -am -DskipTests -pl tck-executor
----

IMPORTANT: Globally unique subscription names are not supported so the corresponding tests are skipped.
