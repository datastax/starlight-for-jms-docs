= Enabling server-side filters
:page-alias: docs@starlight-for-jms::pulsar-jms-server-side-filters.adoc

{starlight_jms} version {product_version} offers *server-side filtering*, which executes JMS filtering features on the Pulsar Broker instead of the Client. +
Before {product_version}, filtering was implemented with `jms.enableClientSideEmulation=true` on the Client side, which meant the Client application received all messages, even if they didn't match the filter. This caused inefficient network, CPU, and memory usage.

Server-side filtering offloads the filtering to the Broker nodes and includes the following JMS filtering features:

* *Broker-side message selectors* - The Broker filters messages instead of the Client
* *Per-message* `timeToLive` - each message can have a time to live value
* `noLocal` *filter* - Filter out messages sent from the same connection

Server-side filtering requires Pulsar *2.10.1+* or Luna Streaming *2.10+*.

== Enable server-side filtering

The `.nar` file filter is packaged with Luna Streaming *2.10.03+* and also available in the GitHub repo https://github.com/datastax/pulsar-jms/releases/tag/2.0.0[here].

. Install {starlight_jms} version {product_version} with the fat JAR that includes all dependencies. Put the `.nar` file in `/pulsar/filters`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The path for the .nar is relative to your Pulsar directory.  
====
For more, see xref:pulsar-jms-quickstart-sa.adoc[Standalone quick start].

. Modify `PulsarConnectionFactory` in {starlight_jms} to disable client-side emulation and use server-side filtering:
+
[source,java]
----
jms.enableClientSideEmulation = false;
jms.useServerSideFiltering = true;
----

. Modify `broker.conf` to accept `entryFilterNames` and to look for the `.nar` file in `/pulsar/filters`:

[source,java]
----
entryFilterNames=jms
entryFiltersDirectory=/pulsar/filters
----

You're ready to use server-side filtering.

[#selectors]
== Configure per-subscription message selectors on the Broker

{starlight_jms} allows you to pre-configure the `selector` property when creating your Pulsar subscription. Modify `PulsarConnectionFactory` in {starlight_jms} to include:

[source,java]
----
jms.filtering=true
jms.selector=YOUR MESSAGE SELECTOR
----

If you have deployed the `.nar` file and configured the `entryFilterNames` and `entryFiltersDirectory` properties in `broker.conf`, the Broker will begin filtering messages automatically.

This only partially works for a non-JMS client, because batch messages cannot be completely filtered out by the Broker. If you use this feature, you should use the Starlight for JMS 2.x client and the `jms.useServerSideFiltering` feature.

In this case, the server-side filter applies both to JMS queues and JMS topics. The JMS client automatically downloads the `jms.selector` from the subscription and applies it locally, where batch message filtering may have partially accepted the message on the Broker.

[NOTE]
====
If you set `jms.selector` on the subscription **and** set a message selector on the JMS client, the conditions on the subscription **and** the JMS client will both be fulfilled. 
====

== Limitations

* *Batch messages* - Server-side filtering works on the Entry level in Pulsar. An *Entry* is a *single message* or a *single batch of messages*. The Broker can't filter out a few messages in a batch; it either passes completely or fails completely.
+
For example, if a batch message is partially accepted by the Broker filter, the Broker will still send the entire batch to the Client, and the Client will execute the filter locally.
If you don't want the Client to receive unwanted messages, disable batching on your producers.
+
[NOTE]
====
Pulsar IO Sources enable batching and compression by default.
====

For more, see xref:pulsar-jms-batch-ack.adoc[Batch index acknowledgement].

* *Increased Broker resources usage* - The Pulsar Broker does not perform processing on messages by default. When server-side filtering is enabled, the Broker will require additional CPU and heap memory to process filters.
+
DataStax recommends disabling compression and batching for messages that will be filtered on the Broker.
Batch messages with compression will consume a non-negligible amount of CPU, heap, and direct memory, because filtering requires decompressing the batch to access Message Properties. This *does not* apply to compressed single messages.

* *Unsupported message types* - {starlight_jms} does not support encrypted batch messages because the filter can't decode the payload of the entry.
For the same reason, {starlight_jms} does not support custom formats like native Kafka messages.
