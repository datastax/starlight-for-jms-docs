[#client-id]
== Client identifiers

Each connection may have a client identifier that can be set programmatically or configured administratively using the  `jms.clientId` configuration parameters. Client identifiers must be globally unique but there is no way to enforce that constraint on a Pulsar cluster.

When you set a `clientId`, the actual subscription name in Pulsar is constructed as `clientId + '_' + subscriptionName`.

[#dead-letter-policy]
== Dead letter topic configuration

*Dead letter policy* controls Pulsar's handling of messages that can't be processed successfully. Under normal processing conditions, these messages cannot be processed successfully and the consumer cannot move to the next message. +

One solution for this situation is the *dead letter topic* policy. The *dead-letter topic* policy routes the unsuccessful messages to the *dead-letter topic* for storage, so consumers can keep consuming while the unsuccessful messages are stored in the dead-letter topic for processing or evaluation. 

{starlight_jms} allows further configuration of `deadLetterPolicy`. For more on `deadLetterTopic` configuration properties, see xref:reference:pulsar-jms-reference.adoc[].
[source,language-java]
----
Map<String, Object> deadLetterPolicy = new HashMap<>();
    consumerConfig.put("deadLetterPolicy", deadLetterPolicy);
    deadLetterPolicy.put("maxRedeliverCount", 1);
    deadLetterPolicy.put("deadLetterTopic", deadLetterTopic);
    deadLetterPolicy.put("initialSubscriptionName", "dqlsub");
----

=== Dead letter topic triggers

A message being written to the dead-letter topic is triggered in one of two ways: +

* xref:pulsar-jms-implementation.adoc#ack-timeout[Acknowledgement timeout]
* xref:pulsar-jms-implementation.adoc#negative-ack[Negative acknowledgement]

[#ack-timeout]
=== Acknowledgement timeout

In an *acknowledgement timeout*, the broker fails to receive an acknowledgement from a consumer in the amount of time specified in `ackTimeout`. +
The `ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff` values control the time between the expiration of `ackTimeout` and the client sending a `redeliver unacknowledged messages` request to the broker. 
[source,java]
----
 Map<String, Object> ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff = new HashMap<>();
    consumerConfig.put("ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff", ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff);
    ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff.put("minDelayMs", 10);
    ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff.put("maxDelayMs", 100);
    ackTimeoutRedeliveryBackoff.put("multiplier", 2.0);
----

[#negative-ack]
=== Negative acknowledgement

In a *negative acknowledgement*, the broker receives a *negative acknowledgement* indicating that a consumer did not process a message, so the broker tries re-delivering the message. +
When the number of re-deliveries exceeds the value specified in `maxRedeliverCount`, the message is routed to the dead letter topic. +
The `negativeAckRedeliveryBackoff` values control the time between the broker receiving the negative acknowledgement and attempting redelivery.
[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> negativeAckRedeliveryBackoff = new HashMap<>();
    consumerConfig.put("negativeAckRedeliveryBackoff", negativeAckRedeliveryBackoff);
    negativeAckRedeliveryBackoff.put("minDelayMs", 10);
    negativeAckRedeliveryBackoff.put("maxDelayMs", 100);
    negativeAckRedeliveryBackoff.put("multiplier", 2.0);
----

A few usage notes on negative acknowledgement in {starlight_jms}:

* Calling `Session.recover()` stops delivery in the session, restarts message delivery with the oldest unacked message, and sends *negative acknowledgements* to the broker for the unacked messages. 

* When using xref:reference:pulsar-jms-reference.adoc[client side emulation] with *JMS Queues* and *Shared Subscriptions*, if a message does not match the xref:pulsar-jms-implementation.adoc#message-selectors[Selector], the JMS Client *negatively acknowledges* the message to let another consume pick up the message. +

* When using xref:pulsar-jms-server-side-filters.adoc[server side filtering] and xref:pulsar-jms-implementation.adoc#message-selectors[Selectors], there is still a chance that a *negative acknowledgement* will be sent when one message in a batch does not match the filter. +
Using *negative acknowledgement* increases the count of deliveries of the message, which can trigger routing to the dead-letter topic if the number exceeds `maxRedeliverCount`. So if you're seeing messages in the dead-letter topic that shouldn't be there, they might be hitting a consumer with a local selector that doesn't match too many times. 

[#delayed-messages]
== Delayed messages

In Pulsar, delayed messages are delivered immediately, without respecting the delay, in the case of exclusive subscriptions. In order to mitigate that behavior, {starlight_jms} allows you to use shared subscriptions even where an exclusive subscription would be a better fit. The most notable case is `Session.createConsumer(destination)`, which creates an unnamed subscription, and an exclusive subscription would be a better fit.

If you set `jms.useExclusiveSubscriptionsForSimpleConsumers=false` the client will use a Shared subscription, and the delay is respected.

See https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-26:-Delayed-Message-Delivery[PIP-26,window=_blank] for details.

[#global-registry]
== Global registry of subscription names and of `clientIds`

The JMS specifications require a subscription name, together with the `clientId`, to be globally unique in the system. In Pulsar, the subscription name is defined in the scope of the Topic, so you can use the same subscription name on two different topics, referring to distinct entities.

The most notable side effects while using Pulsar with the JMS API are:

* `Session.unsubscribe(String subscriptionName)` cannot be used, because it refers to the `subscriptionName` without a topic name.
* In instances such as changing a message selector, you must _unsubscribe_ the old subscription and create a new subscription.

In Pulsar, {starlight_jms} can't attach labels or metadata to subscriptions, and can't enforce that a subscription is accessed globally using the same "message selector" and `noLocal` options. Pulsar does not have the concept of `clientId`, so it is not possible to prevent the existence of multiple connections with the same `clientId` in the cluster. Such a check is performed only _locally_ in the context of the JVM/Classloader execution using a _static_ registry.

[#message-listeners]
== Message listeners and concurrency

The JMS specifications require a specific behavior for `MessageListener` in respect to concurrency, and to support that, {starlight_jms} starts a dedicated thread per `MessageListener` session.

There are also specific behaviors mandates regarding these APIs:

* `Connection/JMSContext.start()`
* `Connection/JMSContext.stop()`
* `Session.close()/JMSContext.close()`
* `Connection/JMSContext.close()`

{starlight_jms} implements its own concurrent processing model in order to obey the specs, but it cannot use the built-in facilities provider by the Pulsar client.

For `CompletionListeners`, which are useful for asynchronous sending of messages, {starlight_jms} relies on the Apache Pulsarâ„¢ asynchronous API, but there are some behaviors that are yet to be enforced with respect to `Session/JMSContext.close()`.

[#message-properties]
== Message properties

In Pulsar properties are always of type String, but the JMS specs require support for every Java primitive type. In order to emulate that behavior for every custom property set on the message, {starlight_jms} sets an additional property that describes the original type of the property.

For instance if you set a message property `my-key=1234` (integer), {starlight_jms} adds a property `my-key_jmstype=integer` in order to properly reconstruct the value when the receiver calls `getObjectProperty`.

The value is always serialized as string. For floating point numbers, {starlight_jms} uses `Double.toString/parseString` and `Float.toString/parseString` with the behavior mandated by Java specifications.

[#message-selectors]
== Message selectors and `noLocal` subscriptions

Message selectors let you choose not to receive messages that do not meet a given condition while `NoLocal` subscriptions prevents a consumer from receiving messages sent by the same connector that created the consumer itself.

Both of those features can be emulated on the client side with the following limitations:

* For exclusive subscriptions, the message is discarded on the client and automatically acknowledged.
* For shared subscriptions, especially on queues, the message is discarded on the client and is "negative acknowledged" in order to let other consumers receive the message.
* For `QueueBrowsers`, the message is discarded on the client side.

Currently, the implementation of message selectors is based on Apache ActiveMQÂ® Java client classes, which are imported as a dependency in {starlight_jms}.

NOTE: Apache ActiveMQ is licensed under Apache 2.0.

[#subscription-creation]
== Subscription creation

For {starlight_jms} to create subscriptions it must be granted permission, and the broker must be configured to automatically create subscriptions by setting the `allowAutoSubscriptionCreation=true` parameter on the broker configuration.

For more on subscription creation, including disabling automatic subscription creation, see xref:reference:pulsar-jms-mappings.adoc#subscriptions[JMS subscriptions].

[#system-properties]
=== System properties and fields:

Properties processed by {starlight_jms} in a special way:

* All properties with a name ending in `_jsmtype`: Additional properties that contain the original data type.
* `JMSType`: Value for the standard field `JMSType`.
* `JMSCorrelationID`: Base64 representation of the standard `JMSCorrelationID` field.
* `JMSPulsarMessageType`: Type of message.
* `JMSMessageId`: Logical ID of the message.
* `JMSReplyTo`: Fully qualified name of the topic referred to by the `JMSReplyTo` field.
* `JMSReplyToType`: JMS type for the `JMSReplyTo` topic. Allowed values are `topic` or `queue` (default: `topic`).
* `JMSDeliveryMode`: Integer value of the `JMSDeliveryMode` standard field, in case it differs from `DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT`.
* `JMSPriority`: Integer value of the priority requested for the message, in case it differs from `Message.DEFAULT_PRIORITY`.
* `JMSDeliveryTime`: Representation in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch of the `JMSDeliveryTime` field.
* `JMSXGroupID`: Mapped to the `key` of the Pulsar message. Not represented by a message property.
* `JMSXGroupSeq`: Mapped to Pulsar Message `sequenceId` if it isn't overridden with a custom value.
* `JMSConnectionID`: ID of the connection.

Special message field mappings:

* property `JMSXDeliveryCount`: Mapped to `1` + the Pulsar message `RedeliveryCount` field.
* field `JMSExpiration`: Representation in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch of the expiration date of the message. Used to emulate time to live.
* field `JMSRedelivered`: Mapped to `true` if `JMSXDeliveryCount` > `1`

Ignored fields:

* `JMSXUserID`
* `JMSXAppID`
* `JMSXProducerTXID`
* `JMSXConsumerTXID`
* `JMSXRcvTimestamp`
* `JMSXState`

For more details on JMS properties, refer to section "3.5.9. JMS defined properties" in the https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/816-5904-10/816-5904-10.pdf[JMS 2.0 specifications,window=_blank].

[#transaction-emulation]
== Transaction Emulation

{starlight_jms} and Pulsar fully support JMS transactions, and also support emulating `SESSION_TRANSACTED` behavior without actually performing the transaction's operations. 

For example, when porting a JMS application that is using `SESSION_TRANSACTED`, you can emulate `SESSION_TRANSACTED` behavior with the `jms.emulateTransactions` feature. 

In `jms.emulateTransactions` mode, when a `SESSION_TRANSACTED` mode is created, the Session behaves like a transacted Session but is not transactional: a produced message is sent immediately, and acknowledgements are sent during `session.commit()`.

To enable transaction emulation, add `"jms.emulateTransactions", "true"`, as below:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> properties = new HashMap<>();
    properties.put("webServiceUrl", cluster.getAddress());
    properties.put("enableTransaction", "false");
    properties.put("jms.emulateTransactions", "true");
----

[#unsupported-features]
== Unsupported and emulated features

The JMS 2.0 specifications describes broadly a generic messaging service and defines many interfaces and services. Apache PulsarÂ® does not support all of the required features, and {starlight_jms} is a wrapper over the Apache Pulsar Client.

Most of the features that are not natively supported by Pulsar are emulated by {starlight_jms}, which helps in porting existing JMS based applications. 

TIP: If you want to use emulated features, but the emulated behavior does not fit your needs, please open an issue in order to request an improvement for the Pulsar core.

|===

NOTE: {starlight_jms}, when run using Apache Pulsar 2.7.x passes most of the TCK, except for the few tests requiring globally unique subscription names.

[#temporary-destinations]
== Temporary destinations

Temporary destinations are created using `Session.createTemporaryQueue` and `Session.createTemporaryTopic` and should create a destination that is automatically deleted then the connection is closed. In Pulsar, since there is no concept of a JMS Connection, that behavior cannot be implemented.

{starlight_jms} emulates the behavior by trying to delete the destination on `Connection.close()` and in `ConnectionFactory.close()` but there is no guarantee that that will eventually happen, if, for instance, the client application crashes or a temporary error occurs during the deletion of the destination.

NOTE: Creating a temporary destination requires the client to be allowed to create the destination and also to configure the broker to allow automatic topic creation using `allowAutoTopicCreation=true`.

[#auth-on-creation]
== Username and password authentication 

{starlight_jms} currently supports only JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, but offers an alternate method of registering `authParams` when connections are created. +

Setting the configuration property `jms.useCredentialsFromCreateConnection=true` when creating a new connection will pass the `username` and `password` pair from the `createConnection(username, password)` or `createContext(username, password, mode)` methods into `authParams`.

To set the configuration when creating a new connection or context, add `jms.useCredentialsFromCreateConnection=true` as below:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> configuration = new HashMap<>();
configuration.put("jms.precreateQueueSubscription", "true");
ConnectionFactory factory = new PulsarConnectionFactory(configuration);
...
factory.close();
----

This will pass the `username` and `password` pair into the `PulsarConnectionFactory` constructor. +

A few notes on usage: +

* The values of `username` and `password` depend on the authentication type configured in PulsarClient. Using JWT authentication, the values are: 
** `username`: not used
** `password`: `token:XXXX`, where `XXXX` is the JWT token
* Once a username/password pair is used to start a connection, you must use it for *all subsequent calls*. 
* Only *one* PulsarClient can be held by a PulsarConnectionFactory.

[#schema-registry]
== Using the Pulsar Schema Registry

The JMS API does not have a standard way to consume schema-driven data like https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html[AVRO], but the Pulsar client can automatically apply schema and decode messages to a specific Java Object model. +

Set the `useSchema` flag to `true` with `consumerConfig` to apply schema when consuming data, as below:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> consumerConfig = new HashMap<>();
properties.put("consumerConfig", consumerConfig);
    
Map<String, Object> properties = new HashMap<>();
properties.put("webServiceUrl", cluster.getAddress());
consumerConfig.put("useSchema", true);
----

The consumer will return a specific JMS message depending on the schema type:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Schema type | JMS mapping

| `AVRO`
| `MapMessage` (nesting is supported)

| `KeyValue`
| Maps to a `MapMessage` with `KeyValue<AVRO, AVRO>`, which maps to a `MapMessage` with two entries, 'key' and 'value'

| `STRING`
| `TextMessage`

|===

[NOTE]
====
For all other schema types, the consumer will return a `StringObject`.
====

[#virtual-destinations]
== Virtual destinations

*Virtual destinations* add support for Consumers to receive messages from multiple destinations, known as *multi-topic subscriptions* in Pulsar.

Multiple topics can be subscribed to using *regular expressions* or static *multi-topic lists*. 

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Pattern| Syntax | Example

|RegEx
|`regex:topicnamepattern`
|`regex:example.*`
This will subscribe to all the topic with a name that starts with "example".

|List
|`multi:topic1,topic2,topic3`
|`multi:example,foo,bar`
This will subscribe to the topics named "example", "foo" and "bar"

|===

To embed a multi-topic subscription name using a JMS queue:
[source,java]
----
try (PulsarConnectionFactory factory = new PulsarConnectionFactory(properties); ){
    Queue queue = session.createQueue("multi:example,foo,bar:subscription");
}
----

For more on multi-topic subscriptions in Pulsar, see the https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/client-libraries-java/#multi-topic-subscriptions[Pulsar documentation].
