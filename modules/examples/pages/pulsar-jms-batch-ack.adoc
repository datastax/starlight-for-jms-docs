= Batch index acknowledgement
:page-alias: docs@starlight-for-jms::pulsar-jms-batch-ack.adoc

{starlight_jms} version {product_version} improves acknowledgement of batched messages by supporting the tracking of 'ack' status by *batch index*. +

By default, filtering works on the *entry* level in Pulsar. An *entry* is a *single message* or a *single batch of messages*. The client will not filter out a few messages in a batch; it either passes completely or fails completely. +

With *batch index acknowledgement*, when the broker dispatches messages, it will carry the batch index that has been acknowledged. The client will filter out batch indexes that have been acked. +

The client sends the batch index ack information to the broker, so the broker can maintain the batch index ack status. +

This approach requires cooperation between the client and broker, so we must modify both `broker.conf` and the `consumerConfig` JMS client property to enable batch acknowledgement. +

DataStax *strongly recommends* these configurations for increased efficiency, whether using *broker-side* or *client-side* selectors.

== Enable batch index acknowledgement

. Add the configuration property `acknowledgmentAtBatchIndexLevelEnabled=true` to `broker.conf`:
+
[source,java]
----
acknowledgmentAtBatchIndexLevelEnabled=true
----

. Set the `consumerConfig` property on the JMS client by adding `consumerConfig.put("batchIndexAckEnabled", true);` to `consumerConfig` in the ConnectionFactory configuration:
+
[source,java]
----
    Map<String, Object> properties = new HashMap<>();
    properties.put("webServiceUrl", cluster.getAddress());
    Map<String, Object> consumerConfig = new HashMap<>();
    consumerConfig.put("batchIndexAckEnabled", true);
    properties.put("consumerConfig", consumerConfig);
    try (PulsarConnectionFactory factory = new PulsarConnectionFactory(properties));
----
